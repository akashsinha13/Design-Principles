# Keep It Simple and Stupid (KISS) principle

This principle is a reminder to keep our code simple and readable for humans. If our method handles multiple use-cases, split them into smaller functions.

Unreadable and long methods will be very hard to maintain for programmers, bugs will be harder to find, and we might find ourself violating DRY principle at some point.
